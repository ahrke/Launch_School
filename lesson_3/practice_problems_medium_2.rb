# Question 1
# I think the object ids of all outer variables will remain the same, as the
# loop will not be able to mutate the original variables, however, the
# outer variables inside the loop will have a different object id, but that
# is only temporary, as the inner block has created a variable of the same
# name, but with different pointer locations. At the end, the out variables
# will retain their values. This is an over-generalization however, as 
# reassigning strings, and array elements will cause the original variable to
# point to a new object, resulting in a different object id

# I was wrong. the variables all point to a different object after the loop
# completed it's duties. My mistake was looking at the loop as if it created
# it's own block with it's own scope

# Question 2
# Here, I would venture that my initial conclusion to Question 1, would be valid
# for this situation. The original variables being passed in to 
# an_illstrative_method(..), will still point to the same objects once
# that method is complete. However, while we're inside the method, the variables
# created by the method, will initially reference the same objects as the 
# original, until they are reassigned. Though, because reassignment in a 
# method is not permanent, it does not affect the original variables.

# Question 3 and 4
# both of these questions have been repeated from practice_1

# Question 5
