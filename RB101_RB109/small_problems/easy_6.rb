# Question 1
# Cute angles
# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle 
# between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in 
# degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (Â°) to represent 
# degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to 
# represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

# Question 3
# Fibonacci Number Location By Length
# Give us your feedback
# Fibonacci Number Location By Length
# The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) 
# such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number 
# is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the 
# natural world.
# 
# Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results
# grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is
# 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that
# it takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 2 digit number.
# 
# Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci 
# number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first 
# Fibonacci number has index 1.)

# Question 4
# Reversed Arrays (Part 1)
# Write a method that takes an Array as an argument, and reverses its elements in

# Question 6
# Combining Arrays

# Question 8
# Find the Duplicate
# Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the
